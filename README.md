# Overview
- i3 window manager config and scripts, tuned to help me manage my
  Parkinson's Disease symptoms, but adaptable to meet others' needs.
- This is the third such repository I've made. This time, I'm hoping
  to make it easy for people to download and run.
- At the moment (May 2020) the repo is just an offsite backup for
  refactored code. Aiming to ship in June.

# Installation
- Dopamine wants tobe installed anywhere beneath ${HOME},
  in a directory accessible to git.

# Deployment
- Dopamine wants to be deployed in "${HOME}/local/bin".
- Dopamine is deployed by typing "make" in the install directory.
