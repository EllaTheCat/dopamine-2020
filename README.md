# dopamine-2020
i3 window manager config and scripts, tuned to help me manage my Parkinson's Disease symptoms.
This is the third such repository I've made. I'm hoping to make it easy for people to download and run.
At the moment (May 2020) the repo is just an offsite backup for refactored code. Aiming to ship in June.
