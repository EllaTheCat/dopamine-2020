# Objective: Show a facsimile of a running program with a commentary.
#
# Solution: This module can screengrab still images or capture short
# videos from the desktop. These clips can then be aggregated to make
# a demo video in the style of YouTube.

#
# Record a region on the desktop for three minutes.
#
# Pass 1 captures live video and saves it uncompressed in shared memory.
# Pass 2 converts uncompressed video from pass 1 to mp4 and saves it to HDD.
#
# The 'start' and 'stop' invocations support one way of working but
# the preferred invocation is <seconds>. This constrains the capture
# duration and hence can avoid shared memory exhaustion.
#
# A 3 minute test recording at 1920x1080 (HD) used 11 Gbytes for the
# uncompressed video. My machine has 16 Gbyte /dev/shm, one half of
# the 32G of actual RAM. Encoding took my machine to 64 degrees C with
# all cores busy and ran at 3.26x real-time.
#
# If you prefer to write to HDD or SSD, that's less likely to run out
# of space. The bandwidth is about 500 Mbits/s. I can't speak about
# SSD or HDD stalls.
